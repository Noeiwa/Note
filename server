Now that you've got everything all set up, you'd probably like to add a website to it. By default, all of the files Apache serves
up to the internet are located at "/var/www/". However, you cannot write to this folder. Let's make it so you can:

sudo usermod -g www-data [YOUR USERNAME]
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www


Enable cgi-bin by
sudo a2enmod cgi
